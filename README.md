  ## Description 
  
  This website is a full-stack program that uses a database to store data entered by the user on the website. Tech Blog is exactly what it wounds like. It is a place where tech enthusiasts can gather to share ideas with eachother in a community blog setting. After creating an account a user can create a post, edit their own post, or delete it if they like from the dashboard. Users can also comment on each others posts. All this is done to give 'techies' a place to come together.
